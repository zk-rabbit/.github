# Branch Guideline

Branch names must only consist of `[a-z|A-Z|0-9|-|/]` characters and be in the form `<type>/<subject>`.

- `<type>` : One of the defined [Commit Types](/COMMIT_MESSAGE_GUIDELINE.md#type) we use.
- `<subject>` : Starts with an imperative verb. Explains the goal of this branch.

An example of a viable branch name is `feat/add-xyz`.
