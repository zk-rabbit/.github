# Pull Request Guideline

We value **clarity** and **traceability** in our codebase.
Even for small changes (e.g., timeout adjustments), if the change is **non-trivial**, please provide context and reasoning to help reviewers and future contributors understand the intent.

Keep in mind:

> A PR author is one, but reviewers are many.
> Write in a way that even a first-time visitor to the project can grasp the context.
